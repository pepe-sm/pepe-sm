 ## Stephen Mburu Gitau's Portfolio

Hello! My name is Stephen Mburu Gitau. I recently graduated in 2020 with a Bachelor of Science in Informatics, with a second upper division. I have a strong background in data analysis and reporting, as I previously worked for the government doing data entry and analysis tasks. I am skilled in using Excel and Access for data manipulation and visualization.

Currently, I am enrolled in alx Africa, and I am focusing on improving my coding skills. I solve coding problems daily and have already achieved some significant milestones. For example, I have built a shell in C and a hash table. 

My experience in C coding includes working with `int main (*argc **argv)`, recursion, variadic functions, and solving small, complex problems. One interesting problem I solved was switching variables, which actually helped me understand the bubble sort algorithm better. 

In addition to C, I am also learning Python. I have already created a Airbnb project with console in Python that manipulates class instances. This is achieved through the `cmd.Cmd` function, which provides a variety of functions for interactive mode coding. With this console, I can add and delete class instances, as well as manipulate and analyze them, which greatly aids in the development process.

In summary, my portfolio showcases my skills and experience in data analysis, C programming, and Python development. I am constantly learning and improving my coding skills, and I am currently working on building a static web page for a project. I am dedicated to continuous learning and growth, and I am excited to keep improving and pushing my limits in the field of programming.
